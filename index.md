### [Linear Regression Project](https://github.com/andywu803/Linear-Regression-Project)

This project is a simple Linear Regression Project found online on Kaggle to demonstrate skills in using pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. It also explores machine learning code with sklearn. A model is created from the given dataset in order to predict more data.

### [Mandelbrot Project](https://github.com/andywu803/Mandelbrot)

This project is written in C# and displays a Mandelbrot set and allows you to zoom in by dragging with the left-click and resetting to the original image with the right click.

The Mandelbrot set consists of all of those (complex) c-values for which the corresponding orbit of 0 under x2 + c does not escape to infinity. When graphed on a plane this results in the generation of a fractal.

### [Snake Game](https://github.com/andywu803/snake-game)

A simple snake game made in Python using the Turtle library. The controls are either through the arrow key or WASD, and like your average snake game, the game ends when you collide the head with either the body segments or the wall. I made this project to get my feet wet using Python and to practice some of the syntax.
